        <h4>Tractor Enthusiast MP</h4>

        <p>
            Conservative MP Neil Parish, has had the whip suspended due to allegations
            <br />that he had watched inappropriate videos on his phone in the house of commons.
            <br />He appeared in a GB news interview before he was known as the offender
            <br />stating that the MP in question should be <em>"dealt with and dealt with seriously"</em>.
            <br /><br />When it came out that he was that MP in question, he said that he viewed the
            <br />videos by mistake. Supporters of Parish have suggested
            <br />that he might have been looking at <em>"Class Dominator Tractors"</em>, a type of
            <br />combine harvester. Supposedly, he had been looking at the tractors and mistakenly went onto
            <br />the wrong website. Supporting his defence, Parish has been pictured standing next to tractors
            <br />many times in the past. Unfortunately, trolls on twitter have been creating memes about this
            <br />incident, mocking the seriousness of the situation.
            <br />On the 30th of April 2022, Parish resigned as MP.
